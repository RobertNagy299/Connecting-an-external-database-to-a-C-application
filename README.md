<h1>Connecting an external database to a C# application</h1>

 <!--### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)-->

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a C# program I wrote that was originally implemented in a Unity game, But before implementing it in Unity, I had written and tested it as a simple console application. The PHP scripts can be found in my "TDGame-Database" repository.

The database ceased operation, due to the project members splitting up.
